# Cognizant-mock-hackathon

## src code can be found at: CTS-Mock-Hackathon/Basics/src/

This problem was solved in 2 different approaches:

In the first approach : In Hackathon.java file, I've converted the data in memory.txt file into JSON format and disaplyed on console.

In the sconnd approach: In Main.java file, I've converted the data in memory.txt file into JSON format and sent the data in to .JSON file. I've also provide output.json file. please check it.
